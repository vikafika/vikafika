- 👋 Hi, I’m @vikafika
- 👀 I’m interested in learning C#. I'm quite new to this, but eager to shift from a business focused career path to a more technically capable path. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# with https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on where my code is faulty, and what I don't yet see is how exactly a code can be nicely readable - I guess this takes experience to understand... (?)
- 📫 How to reach me: viktoria.szkv@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns:
- ⚡ Fun fact: next time :)
